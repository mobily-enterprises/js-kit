This needs to be redone from absolute scratch:

 * DONE Make a store called "tabs"
 * DONE Make it so that registering means posting to the tabs store
 * DONE Do NOT add a public URL for the store so that it's not online by default (only blind post avaiable by default)
 * DONE Only user/tab pairs are registered, NO workspaceId

 * Broadcasting:
   * NO  userId, NO  workspaceId: broadcast it to EVERYBODY
   * ANY userId, YES workspaceId: Broadcast it to EITHER all users in workspaceId (multihome) or EVERYBODY (no multihome)
   * YES userId, NO  workspaceId: Broadcast it to EITHER all users in workspaces with userId (multihome) or EVERYBODY (no multihome)
* Possible broadcasts:
  * EVERYBODY
    - Sendlist is every user with an active tab
  * All in WorkspaceId
    - For each userId in workspaceId (using WorkspacesUsers)
      - If userId has an active tab, add it to the sendlist
  * All in workspaces where userId is part of that workspace
    - For each workspaceId the user is in (using UserWorkspaces)
      - For each userId in that workspace (using WorkspaceUsers)
        - If the user has an active tab AND it's not a dupe, add it to the sendlist
