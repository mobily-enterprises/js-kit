  THE APPLICATION
  ---------------


  PLAN OF ATTACK:
  * DONE Pass Schema and searchSchema to db layer, make it use it to cast/validate data when fetching and inserting

  **
    X Pass ref: to constructor, store it
    X Make a refRegistry variable to hold what changes, put it in the prototype

  **
    - Store all (VALIDATED) refs in _autoLoad, recursively, populate parents if a child has records added
    - Add _searchData as well as _autoLoad, have all text fields in capital letters. This is the same as  the other one,
      except that fields are in capital letters!

    - Implement single-lookup autoload
    - When searching, search in _searchData. If there are "dots" in the search, assumed a join, search the right fields in _ref
    - Add a function to redo _searchData and _autoLoad for every child of a field

  **
    Store all keywords in _keywords, recursively
    Add a "keyword" search in the searching options, will search keywords

  * Allow indexing of sub-documents (keywords and search data) the right way with all necessary indexes, exposing a simple API

  * Update JsonRestStores so that it uses the new db infrastructure and new search abilities, let is pass a store in ref: (rather than coll) 

  * Write tests for all this

  "CONTACTS -- THE BASICS"
  
  * Check the ordering of the contacts widget, sort by name or surname option
    Add user-wide settings, that is respected when first creating the contact list

  * IMPORTANT: Find a way to find "starred" users only, or "category X" users only

  * Add a "category" for a user, think of easiest way to implement what's now possible with Entertainers. "Groups"?

  * Make up an example with DnD dragging, use body preprocessing, see if it does it (create list of "favourite contacts")

  "CONTACTS -- AND USERS"

  * Link contacts with users, make sure that each newly created user has a contact attached to it (userId field in contact)
  * Have "Tell us about you" screen when creating workspace, place contact editing in UserConfig
    In UserConfig, add option to have a default country code for SMSes and contact data entry

    This will require a "tick" widget where the list will depend on the available groups, cross-matching

  "CONTACTS -- SEARCH"

  **
    Make up filters for contacts (would love to have _one_ search field, really), allow to search for them

  * Write "contact lookup" widget that returns a contact, generic one

  -----------------------
  DEADLINE: 15 March 2014
  -----------------------

  "MESSAGES"

  *****
    Add ability to type messages underneath contacts, send a message to multiple recipients (1:n)
    - Use https://bitbucket.org/mutopia/autobox, but maybe use others
    User picks if it's an SMS or if it's an email.  The sending/editing widget will have to change accordingly (SMSes are given less space, no subject)

  "SEND SMS/EMAIL, GATEWAY"

  * Write messages infrastructure, where app can send messages (email, sms) and then a queue manager sends them recording the
    status. Write modules to send (smtp/sms gateway) _and_ receive (pop/sms gateway) messages.
  * Integrate message-sending with the current simple comment infrastructure (!). 
  * Develop the "inbox" for incoming emails/SMSes, mark as read, archived, etc. When an email or SMS comes in, ability to match it to a booking

  "USERS AND INVITES"

  * Write an "invite user" mechanism where users can be invited into the system: they receive an email, will redirect to a screen
    which allows them to register a new user (if available, etc.) or link the workspace to their existing user.
    TO DO THIS, I can definitely get away with just 1) Adding a page that adds a session variable 1a) Redirect to the
    normal welcome page 2) Adding a hook to register and login, so that if that session variable is set, the created user will be
    added to that workspace (UsersWorkspaces store)

  -----------------------
  DEADLINE: 30 April 2014
  -----------------------

  "WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT"

  * Add a "user management" section in settings for workspace Admins only
  * Write a "message browser" for the workspace admin so that they can see exactly what was sent, when, and see the logs
  * Write a "log browser" for workspace owners and for God to see what happened, with filters
  * Decide on permissions/permissions model, maybe follow Drupal's

  "BOOKINGS"

  * Make a "booking": an abstract entity that can be owned by a contact and that has a name and a bunch of people attached.
  ** Ability to have messages under a specific booking, rather than just under a user
  ** Implement simple TODO list for the bookings, date/time from, date/time to, who
  ** Add calendar (Dojox's), rendering users' birthdays and TODO items in it

  ----------------------
  DEADLINE: 30 May  2014
  ----------------------

  "FINISH UP"

  * Make up God permissions mixin, setting God, add them
  * Make God application separate, with separate login (only God can login)

  * Have a look at hotDojoWidgets/lib/hotDojoWidgets.js, image in head will appear, might be good for the app

  "CONTACTS -- INTEGRATION"

  * Add G+ authentication
  **** Allow to sync contacts with Facebook
  **** Allow to sync contacts with G+
  * Add buttons to re-sync all contacts from specified modules


  --------------------------
  DEADLINE: 30 June   2014
  --------------------------

                                                 RELEASE IT
                                                 ----------

  "ADVANCED BOOKINGS"

  * Ability to set available "activities" for a contact and all contacts, with cost
  * product, money lines: [ booking owner | line owner | office ] OWES (min, price max) [ booking owner | line owner | office ] / qty
    where qty can be unit, one-off, hourly, half-daily, daily
  * Ability to match activities (with dates) for a contact in a booking, render them in the calendar

  "ADVANCED MESSAGES AND TEMPLATES"

  * Ability to set "presence types" (dancer, security, paying guest) -- presentational only
  * Ability to send messages to different present types (all types in a booking)
  * Ability to set templates for messages of different types, with instant previews

  "ACCOUNTING"

  * Accounting summaries for each booking (with system-calculated ones)
  * Interface with payment system (Paypal?)
  * Ability to send invoices
  * Ability to _store_ received invoices


 LATER (hopefully other contributors)
  ------------------------------------
  * Use SOCKJS for messaging, no more polling (authentication and reconnection are tricky)
  * Make sure that EditingWidget and StoreSelect are blind-friendly
    Allow country selection for phone number from a select box (straight, Dojo's?)
  * Add animations


  DONE:
  * Password1 and password2, fields, make dependent on each other
  * Understand, fully, the whole "events" on widgets and DOM nodes http://livedocs.dojotoolkit.org/quickstart/events
  * Add a busybutton -- Look into dojox/widgets/standby and forms/busybutton
  * Check things with server, make sure server can respond with form setting error messages
  * Understand _fully_ the whole promise thing in Dojo
  * Write functions for server (sending errors) to keep things dry
  * Initial data saving with MongoDB
  * Write async code to save everything, MAYBE using Async library https://github.com/caolan/async#series (niiice!)
  * Actually create account/workspace with MongoDB
  * CLIENT: Fix forms, as it turns out we don't really need labels (not possible, I was dreaming)
  * Validation/error manager framework:
  -- Change client so that it shows which fields had what problem from the server adding validators on the fly
  -- CLIENT: Add a xhr function for client (making request, writing a message) to keep things dry. Do it with promises and new Form
  -- CLIENT: Make sure that the busybutton itself cancels itself if the form doesn't validate _somehow_
  -- CLIENT: Finish the new warning bar!
  -- CLIENT: Make error printing MUCH nicer than a bloody alert() using the new great bar!
  -- CLIENT: Simplify IFs so that it only needs to cancel if it didn't validate, and do anything if it worked OK. Errors
             and messages handled by generic function 
  -- C/S   : Complete the validation server-side and client-size properly (use the same validators as client side!)
  --SERVER: Make up log library to log ANYTHING with Workspace as a key (not just errors). Log ALL activity
  --CLIENT: Enable logging of all activity with Console.log (to be turned on, so wrap console.log in function)
    +++ THE INTERACTION GALORE (2 days)
  --CLIENT: Create initial Models on the client side for Mongo's data ('workspace')
  --CLIENT: Write more Models for future use/reference (won't work until implemented on server)
    CLIENT: Change COMPLETELY the logic for forms. Make stores "NewWorkspaces" and "NewWorkspacesAsUser" 
  --SERVER: Write function part on server for workspace and username checking (store: "Workspaces" which only works with the
            right filter).
  --CLIENT: Actually check workspace names and user names using AJAX on the client side (don't allow submit if duplicate)
  * SERVER: Reinstall Express, work out what's in the "-s" field (see differences with and without) AND check that app still runs
  * SERVER: Have a look at the middleware used to refresh your memory a little
  * SERVER: Configure a store with Mongodb
  * SERVER: Get familiar with sessions
  * C/S   : Set "logged in variable" when login is successful (store password unencrypted for now)
  * CLIENT: Slim up the submit function, avoid ANY code repetition that is not 100% strictly necessary
  * CLIENT: Write a basic empty applicationwith a simple button to interact with server
  * C/S   : Restructure the whole directory tree so that it makes a lot more sense and can use Dojo 1.8 as a library
  * C/S   : Add logout button to the app and to the server and to the application (make widget), so that we can test things out
  * C/S   : Change app so that if a request is made and response is "unauthorised", asks for login 3 times and after that redirects to login
  * CLIENT: Make sure logging in will _actually_ direct to the app
  * CLIENT: Decide how to store the login name client-side, get client to re-send it
  * C/S   : Change app so that if you are not logged in it will send TO login screen (redirect straight from the jade page)
  * CLIENT: Change login form so that if the user is already set, it will not ask for it again (and option to change user)
  * SERVER: Put the login/logout/register pages (non-data ones) in a separate module
  * C/S   : Add a proper button that does something to test the "session expires" thing to test things properly
  * C/S   : Change the "register" page so that if you are logged in, it redirects to the login page
  * C/S   : Change register form so that if user is already logged in it only asks for the workspace name
- * C/S   : In case user already is logged in, register form should have an info box and explain that they are already logged in and
            the workspace will be registered under their username, providing a logout link too.
  * CLIENT: In case user is not logged in, warn users that if they already are customers, they should login so that
            the workspace will fall under their existing username (with link to a login page)
            * The app URL must always have /workspacename at the end
  * C/S     Do things so that the workspace ID is part of the URL, and not the workspace name, so that URLs stay forever even
            if workspace name changes
  * C/S     Make sure that the workspace name can be appended to the login screen, and that users are automatically redirected there if
            login has worked and user has access to it. To do this, get the login screen to be there with workspaceId set as a variable
            if present, and get the login routine to check if that is available.
  * C/S     Change login screen so that if you login and have only one workspace, redirects there; if you have several workspaces, don't
            redirect: pull out a list of workspaces instead, and let user pick (open them in a new window)
  * CLIENT: Make LoginForm functional, needs to find out the workspace to redirect to from the URL bar using a path
  * SERVER: Finish (write) the picker
  * CLIENT: Add roundForm classes to CSS so that notFound and "error" don't have the loginForm class (silly)
  * CLIENT: Make picker way prettier, 
  * SERVER: Fix problem where if user is logged in, and creates a workspace, he is not added to the permissions (DB changed)
  * SERVER: Change req.XXXX set by workspaceName and workspaceId tokens so that they are under "app", to keep namespace clean
            grep 'req\.[^sbqu]' `find .` Note: change workspaceId's parameter string into workspaceIdPages 
  * SERVER: Tidy up code for middleware, put it in a different file.
  * SERVER: Get TOKENS (rename "key" in db and code) actually created when a user is added.
  * SERVER: Set the token as a global variable in the ws page. The key is worked out by User (from Session) + Workspace id (from page)
  * CLIENT: Change JsonRest call in client so that it automatically appends, to call URL, the key from the global variable
  * C/S   : Revise all code, make sure that names of stores are consistent, place pages under /pages/login, pages/register etc,
            change the store names
  * C/S   : On the server side, a middleware will read the token from URL and set req.application.workspaceId and req.application.userId:
            If the middleware finds that the user is not logged in, needs to return the right 4xx error.
  * SERVER: Check that middleware tokenApi actually works (check by getting Javascript to provide the wrong API key).
  * CLIENT: Hide passwords
  * SERVER: Rename error objects so that make more sense, _and_ make sure that original error is kept in case of "Runtime error".
  * SERVER: Improve the Log() function so that IT does all the work (lookup etc.) and stores things right
  * C/S   : Since 403 is for "user is not logged in", return a different error in case the user IS logged in but has no access to
            the url requested. (It shouldn't happen, and it will only really happen when a permission change happens while the
            user is using the application).
  * SERVER: Find a _good_ way to keep the original error when throwing messages in db errors, maybe providing info to the user? Check
            logging too -- check that logging is happening properly (sent email to stack overflow)
  * SERVER: Uniform the way things are set, into req.application, regardless of what middleware is called
            
  * SERVER: Check logging, and Check that things haven't bombed after latest extensive changes, and that logging still happens OK.
  * C/S   : Revise "protocol", make it a lot better and nicer so that the response is always, always the same (and extra "things" can
            be sent to the app in terms of what to refresh, for example). MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME FORMAT FOR EVERY ERROR
  * CLIENT: Fix password so that it's not "mustChange" in login form (user might decide to change username and not password)
  * SERVER: Change the login scheme completely. The client mustn't send the token for each call, but simply "session" (as an option). On
            the server, the "session" needs to go by workspace. So, when token is "session", setting of variables will depend on
            the session rather than the passed token. (the "login" request makes sense)
  * SERVER: Make a middleware that requires the person to be logged in  (silly idea)
  * SERVER: Understand how the error management works, discovered that throw(err) is the very same as next(err) for the catch{} there
  * SERVER: Change page middleware so that it redirects automatically, without getting the actual routes methods to do it
  * SERVER: Write a middleware for the ID
  * SERVER: Implement logging in case of server problems when delivering pages (add logging calls manually where needed?)
  * SERVER: [NOT DONE] Write a function to check if a user has access to a specific workspace, use that instead of current find() in 3 spots
  * SERVER: Fixed IDIOTIC way I used to give access to workspaces, based on used name rather than ids.
  * SERVER: Major, major reorganisation of the code, errors are now in their own little files, etc.
  * Fixed order of things, so that it makes more sense. This framework is bigger than I expected, will I ever get to write
    the _actual_ booking system I wanted to write? I am amazed something like this didn't exist already
  * SERVER: Made sessions persistent using connect-mongod, fixed a silly bug in the creation of the stores client-side (left from testing)
  * SERVER: Added the first query call
  * CLIENT: Improved the code in _AjaxValidatorMixin.js so that it can work both if search is good or not, improved that code in the meantime
  * Write a module loader which will load all modules in a specific directory and run init(), as well as create a list of
    loaded modules
  * Move the existing calls into a module called "system"
  * Create system so that modules have a public directory
  * Make sure that the application runs some init() method javascript-side as well, so that modules can add their widgets to the app
  * Empty root directory completely (including errors.js etc.), turn it into a straight Express server with modules
  * Write a hook system, server and client side, where other modules can listen and "enrich" each other's objects, forms, etc.
  * Write a topic/publish system, server side, where things can happen
  * Add function to add fields that will be logged by the logger, defining them as "indexes" or not. (This will be used to
    make up the schema on the spot by the mongologger)
  * Add ability to register a module later (change the load function so that it calls register, and then
    make sure that the template is recalculated after the registration for that particular module so that
    JS and CSSes are added). Also, see if it's possible to make file loading work as well (!), this will require
    one middleware call per module). This way, people can use *any* module to integrate with hotplate -- the modules will
    just need to provide the right hooks
  * Put core modules into a "core" directory somehow (revise the way modules are loaded, allow two stage loading and THEN init() )
  * Write dependency system so that init() methods are called in the right order
  * Port "hotDojoError" so that it uses the new globalAlertBar
  * Make application work "as is" (making it use the new hotDojoError and stores etc. )
  * Make sure hooks are called asynchronously so that hooks can be used within callbacks
  * Add function to log to console if turned on (add it to logger), put log messages using that from now on
  * Add function invokeAllFlattened, which gets all results from an invokeAll and flattens them onto an array, to be used for thinks
    like roles etc.
  * Write a topic/publish system, client side, where clients can change other client's forms, templates etc. before they get
    sent to the client. For example, another mixin to _templatedMixin which calls hotplate's hooks?
  * C/S   : Make sure that workspace names are registered as lowercase, AND that searching them is case insensitive!
  * SERVER: Make sure that all servers calls don't BOMB if parameters are not passed (use custom function)
  * SERVER: Set an expiration time to the login, check that it can be "since last communication" (add flag?)
  * CLIENT: Fix problem where field with focus lose manually added tooltip straight away. It's making "wrong password" disappear.
  * C/S   : Encrypt passwords using strong encryption
  * Check for "styles" in templates, and "height", make sure that widgets don't have useless parameters
  * DECIDE IF dojoAppContainer SHOULD BE LEFT LIKE THIS, GENERIC, OR NOT (CONTAINER Vs. BOILERPLATE)
    In the end, it's a generic container publishing a topic with its object, so that others can piggyback
  * SERVER: Create generic function to parse the query launched by JsonRest queries (filter, range) use it for logs
  * CLIENT: Show a bunch of records (grid, etc.) using the data stores. Make sure there is proper error recovery with
            reload if there are network issues. 
  * SERVER: Write a "Dashboard" page for the "system" workspace, with a tab that displays logs (filter by time, user, workspace, gravity)
            Improve logging accordingly (now that you can see them...)
  * Write utility functions to copy data taken from a JsonRest query into a form -- UNNECESSARY!
  * Write an overlay widget which will be placed over a form if initialisation goes wrong. Allow user to click to try again
  * Make app look a little nicer (login button, small avatar, at the top, etc.)
  * Add the overlay widget to Dgrids as well, allowing users to re-load the dgrid if connection goes down. That was fun, discovering that
    dgrid isn't _actually_ a widget and adapting the hell out of _OvelayMixin...
  * Write basic "Workspace settings" (generic Workspace Settings table)
  * Write generic function to find one and save
  * Write basic "Workspace-User settings" (user's settings for that specific workspace). Make fields part of DojoAuth's tables? (Hooks for that)
  * Strenghten existing forms in bd.js (add parametersAreThere as general functions from hotDojoAuth), validate email
  * Write basic "User settings" (General user-wide settings) and show name of logged in user at the top
  * Change the protocol (sigh). Any get needs to return just the object or null. Maybe sendGetResponse, sendPostResponse? 
  * (Don't) Get rid of that stupid "self" in the user config. Use the proper user _id.
  * Make sure that changing a list in point A will also change the select box in point B immediately.
  * Change config so that it comes in a variable at load time. Somehow shove that into the store cache if possible
  * Make both cache and main store observable, shove things into cache at load time, and check that savings/updating works OK)
  * Make sure AppConfig creates a updated object usable straight from the application without running `get` on the store, make sure
    object is updated after `put`. Code to use config values right now is way too long
  * Use comet/messenging to make stores observable by remote. Check that changes apply if 1) They are made within the tab 2) They are
    made from another tab (through comet).
  * Change "self" in id, and write two layers: one for store changes in general, and another one which piggy backs and provides
    real-time configuration changes.
  * Add app-wide tabId, workspaceId, userId as they are just so often used. Maybe, I say maybe, make a namespace
  * Add an aspect to the store's put method to add tabId, and then take it out just before writing, so that the server always knows
    who to notify for config changes
  * Finalised, polished up, re-checked the whole Comet/messages infrastructure
  * Check permissions with permission module. Decide on whether to leave the session minimalistic as it is now ( best way ). Or maybe
    do load the user's config in the session (and refresh it if it gets modified).
  * Get the user form to appear at the top and not on the left
  * Add a link to the user profile in the workspace picker if a user logs in without ANY workspaces. Use Hotplate's Dojo mixin for this
  * Move login/userId from bd.js to hotDojo Auth, where it makes a lot more sense. Document which variables are provided for each page
  * Fix permission of get/post UserConfig (there is no :workspaceId anymore, as it shouldn't). Write a custom Auth function for it
  * Improve ID checking for mongoDB ids, make them one-liners as they are in every single call
  * Fixed mystery of ghost collections created by Mongoose when app started. It was old indexes. ALSO deleted Access as a global Model
  * !! Change the "configuration" form so that if things change (see: version is higher), then it blanks. Note that
    it cannot get registered as a tab, so it won't get the Comet signals etc. Good chance to check versions in general 
    (increment __v when editing etc.)
  * DEFINITELY switch away from Mongoose
  * Write a builder function that creates get() and put() callbacks based on information <--- !!!
  * GET RID OF THOSE GLOBAL VARIABLES in BookingDojo.js. They seemed a good idea at the time... No No No. Maybe make module that works them out
  * Created the SyncPublish widget to make sure that no call is lost
  * Changed the register form to include name and last name
  * Use schemas in postWorkspacesAnon and postWorkspacesUser, and call hooks to change those schemas
  * Use schema anywhere with post/soft validation in hotDojoAuth
  * Use schema hooks to add name and surname to workspace creation calls
  * Make a general widget to edit fields out of the ones currently used in Settings, so that most of the default stuff is done
    - Add alertBar manually to the widget so that users don't have to worry about it
    - See if I can use Jade as the template engine instead of ugly HTML.
    - Convert all forms to new system, make them a _loooot_ shorter!
  * Reorganise code so that all of the Dojo calls are in one spot, and hotDojoAuth is decoupled from Dojo.
  * Take out EVERY ServiceUnavailable errors, just throw the normal errors, and let the error manage deal with it
  * Change JsonRestStore so that it can pass through 'all', 'http', 'none'
  * Fine-tune the error manager so that it handles Json _and_ HTML the right way
  * Rename all core modules hotSomething -> hotCoreSomethig and put ALL modules under node_modules. Test that a clean install works 100%
  * Shared validators made available easily through SimpleSchema
  * Make a local, patched copy of cache.js
  * Take out that rubbish about partial update from Cache.js
  * Change update so that values in schema but NOT in update object are case/set (doesn't this already happen?!?)
  * Make a note: PUT is not partial, it is complete
  * See how dgrid works for rendering lists and provide a custom renderer widget
  * Fix issue where if entries get out of visible area and list is reloaded, it stops adding them to the grid when added! Geeee, I had to
    write my own JsonObserver for this.
  * See if it's OK to pass just the store to EditingWidget as a whole, rather than the two parameters, BOTH for EditingWidget and EditableList
  * Make the "add" form reset after adding in EditingList
  * Move widget to external file, into its own module (the same module that includes dgrid)
  * Take "ds" out of the equation for EditableList, emit a signal instead and display the global error thing in case of problems (not done)
  * Add option to add the *adding* widget (before, after, none)
  * Make a widget to ask for confirmation -- incredibly, Dojo didn't have one
  * Add option for deletion confirmation via alert (on by default)
  * Fix the "submit message" issue (change spot where it appears, or give the option of getting it to appear underneath so that 
    tiny inline forms will still work)
  * Fix the problem with EditingWidget if there is an error -- escape at EditableList must close all editing widgets
  * Make a widget that accepts one store, an editing widget, a displaying widget per item and a "style" (+button at the bottom, in-line
    editing, etc.), and make it render/edit a bunch of items.
  * Select box: create a widget that allows user to pick one amongst one of the allowed line-record -- PLUS the current one!
  * Use Use the dgrid widgets and the select widget as engines for the settings screen, finally finally use it!
  * Fix the veeeery broken system that adds tabId to each request. Now it adds it to the header, which makes it impossible to use for
    deletions. Use aspect.around() and make AppStoreNotify completely agnostic in terms of used store. Move the part about adding 
    tabId to the dojo messages module.
  * Make it possible to place the buttons underneath the widget, aligned to the top, or aligned to the bottom
  * Make it easier to notify multiple stores if a mongoDB table changes, as it's very possible that one different stores will use
    the same table (e.g. users seen by admins and by normal users). MOVE IT to a different hotplate module
  * Redo the function that loads modules in hotplate.js, it's a giant mess right now. Use it for hotCoreJsonRestStores.js
  * Get rid of the "error" variable in hotError, use allhttperrors instead (like you should)
  * Change that workspaceIdCall into workspaceId
  * Change jsonreststores-mongo so that it deals with sub-stores properly
  * YES, DONE (Login) Check if there is a better way to "login", right now it sets a bunch of server variables
  * YES, DONE (Login) Check if hotDojoAuth can be used for other systems (like passport, for example)
  * YES, DONE (Login/other) See if there is a better way to create "drivers" where "hooks" just don't cut it (see: authentication)
  * NO, NOT DONE Add function to add per-module routes to make it easier to add URLs
  * NO, NOT DONE Have a "settings" infrastructure, where modules can define settings widgets which then get added to settings
  * NO, NOT DONE Add functions to hotplate.use() routes allowing definition of stores at the same time (add stores use existing function)
  * REALLY decide on capital letters in collection names, in JsonRestStore docs and in actual code
  * Add a hook so that when a workspace is added, the creating user is also added immediately to that workspace
  * Rewrite "pick" (in hotCoreMultiHome) so that it allows user to pick an existing one and go there immediately
  * Get CONFIG stores to be marked automatically as such
  * Get hotplate to ONLY use hotCoreAuth by writing a new module to deliver a page (both multihome version, and "straight" one)
  * Make the application work again (!)
  * NO, DONE Check if there is a better way to include modules, now each function needs to (because of async inits() ). THere isn't
  * NO, DONE Move hotplate's defined stuff (`vars`, etc.) into its own namespace? Bad idea. using "vars" as a global will work fine
  * Make the application's ability to refresh itself work again (config and normal)
  * Check why login/password in manager (client side) no longer works
  * Add "resume" as an option (resume once logged in)
  * Fortify things a little (pages/ws/undefined works?!?, login widget mustnt come out if redirect vars isn't set, page mustn't be served if
    logged in user ID doesn't exist, pick mustn't work if userId doesn't exist, ...more? )
  * Finish RESUME properly (make widget to show resume buttons, write resume part in Facebook's strategy)
  * Complete missing bits (client/server) in the Local strategy (signin DONE, register DONE, recover )
  * Make resume appear if there is an auth error in the example app
  * Do something so that resuming using ANY method can give the application a visual cue that it happened
  * Fix problem where users cannot change just their password
  * Add password confirmation in management (it's only in register right now)
  * Make auth widgets independent of where they are used, put required variables in hotCoreAuth
  * Take "store" out of the constructor of Manager and Resume because it's silly
  * Implement recovery: for now just create a hash/expiry in login info for future use
  * Fixed JsonRestStores so that unset fields are deleted from the collections (otherwise old data would stay)
  * search for errorPage, change served pages so that they do next(err) rather than calling errorPage
  * sort out custom error page in case token is broken (not sure how to do it)
  * Add permission checks to auth stores, which are all completely open right now
  * Check the WHOLE authentication kaboodle to make sure it's all good
  * Add option so that if there is only one workspace for the user, Pick doesn't show a list but jumps STRAIGHT to the workspace.
  * Add a responseType to hotCoreAuth other than close, redirect etc. so that the window can stay open and actually show customisable contents
  * Convert Hotplate and any other module following the ritard "one singleton per module" pattern to a sane, simple Nodejs module.
  * Document hotplate.js properly, ask in StackOverflow what' a good way to create documentation from files. Needs to be EASY.
  * Fix serialize problem with JsonRestStores (2 ways... now?). Needs to return un-serialised data on GET
  * Chance client so that it uses new generic messages format
  * Finalise the tabIdHash function use -- is it really OK this way? I think so.
  * Finally, see comet actually work again in Hotplate -- it does, it does!
  * Make sure that a tab's lastSync time is updated every time there is a sync
  * Make sure that an expired tab leads to a new request for a new tab, and reset of all client-side stores.
  * Test things, see if everything still works
  * Move the buttonsConstructor somewhere where it makes more sense (fixed early as working on config menus)
  * Normalise all the topic.publish namespace, which is messy now. Watch out: comet events are echoed as well, put those in a different ns
  * Rewrite from scratch the whole "configuration parameters" thing
    * Rewrite the whole config stores so that they allow collections rather than just static values
    * Check that _all_ settings work properly with the new system
    * ATTACK PLAN:
      * [DONE] Make the stores first, the way they should be (6 stores, 3 single-ones, three collection-ones)
      * [DONE] Make the UI to manage those stores.
      * [DONE] Work out the whole storeTarget mess *properly*, see what it is, document it clearly
      * [DONE] Change messages so that storeTarget is out of the equation, with store(storeName) returning all stores in cache
      * [DONE] Rewrite backend so that it figures out, based on IDs, if a store is a list of is a 1-record gig
      * [DONE] Rewrite Dojo-side so that it places things into the cache accordingly
  * make sure that user has permissions to access the workspace when returning WS configuration after reset
  * In hotCoreStoreConfig, make sure that pageElementsPerPage uses workspaceId only if multiHome is enabled
  * MONGO: Add range fields (from schema?)
  * MONGO: Add mass deletion in API
  * COMET: Mass Deletion of tab messages when tab gets deleted
  * COMET: Mass Deletion of tab messages when tab expires (cron job too?)
  * Restructured the whole Comet architecture so that it's all neat and nice to look at.
  * Checked permissions for   hotCoreCometMessages/lib/hotCoreCometMessages.js
  * Made Comet messenging work again 100% using JsonRestStores API only
  * MONGO: Add cursor (with delete option) in API
  * COMET:  See if/when using cursors makes sense
  * Add "remove on fetch" for cursor-based queries (mongoDriver)
  * Add extrapolateAndPrepare in _makeQuery (JsonRestStores)
  * Make sure self.post**** are always the very last step in the chain, it's been "pushed up"
  * See if MassUpdate makes sense, it might well be as it would complete the API. Will need to allow partial updates though
  * Rewrite Hotplate, so that it doesn't have dependencies anymore, it uses enhanced EventEmitter
  * Use "cachable" function for cachable hooks
  * Write a totally custom class rather than extending eventEmitter. Write it so that registering a function requires the module's name,
   and invokeAll groups by moduleName. 
  * In new Invoke, write the aggregating functions and allow invoking for a specific module! 
  * Simplify the return of moduleName in events, change hook.stores() so that it can return an object
  * Change everywhere with hotHooks and any invokation with grep -i invokeAll `find . -type f`
  * Check that everything actually works
  * Get rid of all the registration functions in hotplate, which are now obsolete
  * Move AsyncCollectEvents to its own github module
  * Rewrite hotplate.get to make it object/save to get rid of a few (a lot of) typeof() === undefined, put defaults into modules
  * Check that all the hooks that should be cached are actually cached grep -i hotEvents.on `find . -type f`
  * Make sure that it all works with "use strict";
  * Made _getTabId() more robust in case the header is not there
  * Fixed registration with username/password, which was broken
  * Simplified the flow of all functions in JsonRestStores. More verbose, but clearer
  * Made sure that default error page sends the right HTTP error code
  * Added forgotten error check, minor formatting issues and small issues fixed, indentations
  * Now using Put instead of Post to create predefined user records (current system broken) fix "Put" which doesn't work
  * Finally using hotplate.log, and added tracer, so that logging is much much saner
  * Rewrite the Dojo side, so that it loads module in a much more dojo-style way
  * Made the driver mixin as a POSSIBLE mixin, configure it via Hotplate.
  * Made sure things actually DO work even if no db driver is used
  * Understood the strange 404 error, came up when tabs expire <--- this one was horrible
  * For JsonRestStores, MAYBE force the query to do a normal castAndParams (rather than deleting search)
  * Major rewriting of SimpleSchema and JsonRestStores, changing hotplate too
  * Change _checkParamIds in JsonRestStores so that it uses a much saner approach
  * Add body preprocessing to methods other than POST in JsonRestStores
  * Add generic, schema-less driver
  * Decide on the unit test library I will stick with for the next week
  * Finish writing tests for SimpleDbLayer
  * Change way in which totals are returned for noncursor queries, use third parameter. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
  * Change queries so that they work as documented
  * Understand seriously when/how errors are silent
  * Check versions in packages.js for all recent modules
  * Write mongoDb-specific tests, plug them in somehow
  * Find way to allow case-insensitive searches, add "indexes" hash and query those instead
  * Add case insensitive searches to TingoDb
  * Split SimpleSchema into two, document SimpleSchema, write tests for SimpleSchema and for SimpleSchemaMongo, decide with serialize
  * Finish documenting and Write tests for SimpleDeclare (document async version of inherited)
  * Document and write tests for DeepObject and add class methods to work on a specific object
  * Document and write tests for EventEmitterCollector
  * Write tests for JsonRestStores (which will be buggy as hell). Test it by using API and checking internal param functions
  * Change hotplate so that it works with new DbLayer/JsonRestStores/SimpleSchema
  * Implement TODOs in hotCoreComet (mainly mass delete)
  * Make handleXXXX option FALSE by default, check that things still work
  * Last fix to JsonRestStores -- the paramId issue for updates
  * Change all "_id" into "id", final detachment from MongoDb...
  * Check all hotplate schemas in general, check for `searchable`, take 'required' out of paramId fields
  * Change UserStrategies into UsersStrategy & others
  * Change storeName to capital letters
  * Make things work (again)
  * Finish rewriting hotCorePage 
  * Make bookingdojo "simply work", publish it online
  * Set example application's store names to new standards
  * Make sure that Hotplate AND sample application has security checks when reading/writing records, check ALL of hotplate in general for sanity
  * Change example application to new naming standards, test permission checks just implemented
  * Decide on path standards: prefix for stores, module file paths, all other urls
  * Change config stores so that important parameters CAN be required, maybe use DbLayer to add them
  * See what to do w/ shared code/validators: possibly create another global "Validators" array with just the Validators func (what about dups?)
  * Check escaping of special characters in hotCorePage, if a variable has [[BODY]] what happens?
  * Make sure that tab messages are broadcast when workspaceId not in field (implement TODO in hotCoreJsonRestStores)
  * Make sure that indexes are created/set automatically by simpleSchema library (or DB layer library?)
  * Update docs about indexing for dbLayer, JsonRestStores
  * Check hotDojoCometMessages/client/messages.js and hotDojoStores/client/AppStoreNotify.js: "add" needs to check if it's not within
    "add" like it happens in Observer.js (check if the Observer.js way is indeed sane)
    http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/Problem-with-aspect-around-store-methods-td3999790.html

  * Fix simpleDeclare, as this.inherited is very very broken
  * Fix problem with Jade, decide what to do (drop it?)
  * Change clientPaths hook to clientPath, only one "public" path per module
  * Select items need to be ALL preloaded beforehand, overlay goes away once dgrid is ready.
  * Fix StoreSelect and EditableList so that they are overlayed properly. Also:
    * With "refreshData", change "refresh" to clickable overlay 
    * catch dgrid errors with overlay if necessary
  * Improve overlay: "Loading", "ClickToReload" (with icons accordingly), make the dgrid widgets use it
  * DONE Write a detailed email to the Dojo guys, explaining exactly what I did:
     - Add options.relocation to options in put() in case it's just a relocation
     - Change JsonRestStores (adding headers X-hotplate-relocation and X-hotplate-before)
     - Change Observable.js so that it doesn't use a queryEngine (requires adding adding methodParams to notify() )
     - Tell them about insanities such as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14796968/how-to-implement-row-reordering-with-dnd-in-dgrid
  * Finish JsonRestStores with proper reordering
    - DONE Finish fixing JsonRest.js so that placement is changed if necessary
    - DONE Finish Observable.js properly, so that it extends notify() and actually works 100%
    - DONE Change storeNotify.js so that notify is called with the new parameter (or a new message altogether?)
    - DONE Change the after header, if after is null, send an empty header and not lame string 'null'
		- DONE Change JsonRestStores so that it has a "order" field that gets set according to the passed options.before
    - DONE Change dojo/store/Memory.js so that it keeps into consideration "before" and "relocation" (AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!)
    - DONE Fix MongoDb so that it uses an easier way of doing the counting
    - DONE (Not done, useless burden on Dgrid) Change DnD.js so that it sends a FAKE EMPTY field when `reposition` is true
    - DONE Change JsonRestStores so that it broadcasts 'before' and 'relocation', chose how to do it
    - DONE Fix strange issue where delete grays records, dgrid doesn't refresh (doesn't get notified?)
    - DONE Deploy onto live server on nodejitsu (change dgrid reference in repo)
    - DONE Complete email with links
  * Make timeouts longer for tab expiry (change client/server)
  * Move everything to Dojo 1.9.x
  * Implement artificial delay in JsonRestStores
  * Give visual cue of DnD in hotplate
  * Rewrite _OverlayMixin so that it keeps a counter of how many reload overlays there are, rewrite code so that is uses the new Overlay
  * Fix bug with dialog editing that doesn't work in EditingWidget
  * Give visual cue of adding element in EditingWidget
  * Improve code in dgrid's event emission, avoid repeating code, merge it onto the patch
  * Check bug where select list doesn't get updated
  * Check bug where dispatcher calls fail strangely
  * !!! Understand how to make un-invasive CSSes, "get" CSSes, fix CSS in all widgets
     - http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/Question-on-CSS-with-widgets-td3995316.html
     - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21175377/css-classes-and-widgets-three-questions
  * Improve the look of the app and widgets: welcome and pick to look nicer without abbruzzese
  * Fix busy buttons when login/create accounts, overlay on redirect when creating workspace
  * Change JsoNRestStores so that it's much much more DRY: get paramIds from URL if possible, set the ids in schema from paramIds
    if not in schema
  * IMPORTANT: Check that hotCoreMultiHome still makes sense (check stores.UsersWorkspaces)
  * Reorganise WHOLE application, so that all select boxes and editable lists actually have a point
    - Fix CSS (no inline stuff, make space) in all forms
    - Fix overflow
    - Add "god" tab
    - Move EditableList's css from bdMain to EditableList
    - Add app-wide selectable options for workspace and for user in "god" section
    - Move login info into user config
    - Check that I covered all cases:
      - List no wid nor uid
      - Save/list with only wid
      - Save/list with only uid
      - Save/list with both uid and wid
    - Missing: list with both uid and wid (list of something in userConfig)
    - Add config stores with no wid/uid (loads the lot at startup)
    - Check that Multihome permissions work with only userId, and both in queries and fetching
    - Take out queryParams from postCreate around the code since it's useless
    - Check why buttons don't work in users dialog box (focus issue). Solution: add dijitPopup class to them, focus issue with dialog
    - Automatically focus on first focusable node on startup of EditingWidget
    - Fix conflict between inline editing and DnD. Can't believe I fixed this myself, I think I am getting the whole DOM thing
    - !! Check why horizontal scrollbars appear when editing an inline textbox
    - Add to EditableList the ability to define an extra widget, and display the new Widget in a dialog without repeating code
    - Have "preset" text that disappeares in textbox (Dojo should have it)
  * Document JsonRestStores, paramIds is now optional, publicURL is what counts, id fields are assigned automatically
	- Check why adding an entry doesn't automatically position it at the end (reload after adding to see)
		DECIDED: only accept to add as "last" for ordered and unsorted ones. Later we can add in specific spots easily
						 but for unspecified it needs to be last 
  * Fix stupid bug in JsonRestStores
  * Check why JsonRestStores sends double headers if on line 1048, _relocation is passed null rather than 'null', bad symptom
  * Test if comet does what it's meant to do when broadcasting all store cases
  * Fix the way parameters are passed in EditableList/editingWidget: not storeName and store, but storeName+storeParameters+storeExtraParameters
  * Test that I can nest however many times without losing URL parameters <-- Geeeeeeeeeeeesus
  * Make it possible to pass ONE widget, for editing and adding, since they are (nearly) always the same 
  * Fix successfulsubmit, make it bubble from the editing widgets, and kill the bubbling from the main form. WAY: add "store"
  * Check what you are meant to do when you have a prop you can pass a widget that is also defined in the prototype,
    check that the prop-copying is in the right spot
  * Find a way to have stores where you just add things, and it takes more space as it grows
  * Improve interface for email addresses, make it come out after adding a new email address automatically
  * Improve the UI for email addresses so that it's actually clear what it is
  * Make sure non-children (placed) widgets are destroyed (including buttons!) when EditableList is destroyes
  * Make sure the second half of the contact form is its own widget, that will appear all at once when adding has happened
  * Decide if editable-list needs to be relative (it has an overlay!)
  * Understand strange extra refresh in email dgrid after first email address added -- Dgrid does it, cannot fix it!
  * Resolve issue where dgrid is calling refresh at the same time as bd.js, and in the end there are two overlays as
    dgrid-refresh-complete is only called once. Find/make flag to see if a refresh is happening
  * Check why email is not checked server-side (disable client-side check to see)
  * Do not allow entering same email address twice (only server side!)
  * Make DnD actually work for email addresses
  * Fix JsonRestStore's "positioning", dbLayer needs to be passed a table AND a filter, or it will reorder the WHOLE TABLE!!!
  * Document JsonRestStores with new hook, postValidate(), which is always useful. Consider changing the signatures of others as well
  * Document skipHardLimitOnQueries for select
  * Update tests for JsonRestStores, add TODO for new hook and fix existing hook
  * Update TingoDb with latest code
  * Fix ENORMOUS bug where if a contact is saved twice, there is a post rather than a put (!!!)
  * Make sure that after a new adding, form is reset for email
  * If application is down and a contact is open, reload button missing from email overlay (needs to preload the image)
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21449635/pre-loading-images-in-a-one-page-application
    (In the end, resolved creating TWO overlays and only displaying the right one)
  * Check *ALL* issues regarding editing widget that must reset, writing in the field beforehand, widths, etc.
  * Prettify email widget (adding side)
  * Add birthday, with near date picker. Ths one was easy. Dealing with dates *regardless* of their timezone, however... meh.
  * Implement postal addresses, with a neat interface like emails
  * Make positioning of addresses actually work
  * Check buttons positioning issue ('bottom' is not working)
  * Render somehow an empty address so that there is at least a node
  * Check why dialog doesn't close when adding a new address
  * Check why focus goes to top after adding an address
  * Give more max height to email/addresses widgets (needs to match)
  * Make date selector default to something saner
  * Have a better separator for addresses
  * Add Company Name or "type flag" to contacts (companies don't have middlename, lastname or DOB, so hide them)
  * Deal with textboxes, add hooks to EditableList to deal with form submitting and widget assigning so that checkboxes work
  * Fix horrible resize problem with the contact form
  * Implement phone numbers, with a neat interface like emails and ability to pick the country from a list of country codes
  * Add data about allowed countries somewhere both for client and for server side (shared function!)
  * Check country code and phone number client/server side
  * Add fields "favourite contact" (virtual?), "syncModule" (string, will make it read-only), "syncId" (foreign ID), syncDate, isStarred, notes
  * Make contact "starrable"
  * Add option to offset buttons to the right
  * Fix alignment of loading overlay with star
  * Change widget so that it's about being ticked/unticked, move it to hotplate
  * Make sure extra info is fetched when a contact is fetched (addresses, ph numbers, starred, emails)
 








 

  // PROBABLY WRONG

  * keywords table:

    {
      _type: 'Comments',
      _id: aaa,
      keywords: [
        'A FIRST COMMENT',
        #date('14/2/2014')
      ]    
    }

    {
      _type: 'Comments',
      _id: bbb,
      keywords: [
        'A SECOND COMMENT',
        date('15/2/2014')
      ]    
    }

    { _type: 'Contacts',
      _id: 333
     keywords: [
      'TONY',
      'MOBILY',
      # Date('10/1/76'),
      '11 BITTON ST',
      '24 IVERMEY ROAD',
      'HAMY HILL',
      'A FIRST COMMENT',
      'A SECOND COMMENT'
      # date('14/2/2014'),
      # date('15/2/2014') ]
      # true
    }



* Make the contact list look better, adding columns like Google Contacts.
